Edward: 
What I did:  I finished homework 1 and signed the two papers for the discussion assignment. 
What I need to do next: I need to start reading the selected papers chosen to be presented. 
What is blocking me: I do not see anything blocking me.

Francis:
What I did:  I’m working on the writing component of the qualifier exams, I’m working on homework 1, 
and I signed up the two papers for the discussion assignment. 

What I need to do next is finish homework 1, start reading the two signup papers to be presented in class, 
and finish the writing component of the qualifier exam and presentation slides.

What is blocking me: Homework 1. The way the instruction is structured makes it difficult to follow through.
